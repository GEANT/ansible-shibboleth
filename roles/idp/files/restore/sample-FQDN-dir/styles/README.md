# Styles

Put here the following Identity Provider style's files to be restored:

1. Create the `en/` language's directory and put inside of it these files:
   (Do the same for all languages supported by your IdP and be sure to change `enFlag.png` with `xxFlag.png` where `xx` is the acronym of the language used by `idp_metadata` variable)

 * enFlag.png
 * favicon.png
 * logo.png

2. Copy the `images` directory and replace the federation-logo.png with your federation logo (keep the same filename!).
